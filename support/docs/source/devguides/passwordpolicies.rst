Overview
########

Password policies allow CMS administrators to enforce minimum password strengths. PresideCMS provides a simple user interface for defining password policies. Polices are grouped by a policy context; e.g. the 'CMS' context and the 'Website' context. Currently, only these two contexts exist and are hardcoded in the system
