Website users and permissioning
===============================

Overview
########

PresideCMS supplies a basic core system for setting up user logins and permissioning for your front end websites. This system includes:

* Membership management screens in the administrator
* Ability to create users and user "benefits" (synonymous with user groups)
* Ability to apply access restrictions to site pages and assets through user benefits and individual users
* Core system for dealing with access denied responses (see :ref:`custom-error-pages-401`)
* Core handlers for processing login, logout and forgotten password

The expectation is that, for more involved sites, these core systems will be extended and interacted with to create a fuller membership experience.
